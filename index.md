### Research Interests
I am a postdoctoral fellow in theoretical neuroscience, working with [Asohan Amarasingham](http://math.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/people?name=Amarasingham) (CUNY) and collaborating closely with the [Buzsáki Lab](http://www.buzsakilab.com/) at the Neuroscience Institute (NYU). My current research program is about _in vivo_ dynamics of neural microcircuitry. Key questions include: how can ``place cells’’ in the hippocampus be formed so fast and so reliably? and from a more mathematical perspective, can we recover the diagram of a cell assembly connectivity from the spiking times sequences of each of its elements? I approach these problems through a diverse set of quantitative techniques, ranging from neural dynamics to point process statistics, relying on the analysis of electrophysiological and optogenetic data.

More generally, I am interested in understanding how basic cognitive functions are ``implemented’’ in the brain. To that end, I have worked on the sense of touch, using psychophysics and mathematical modeling.
